## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use AI Vision Coaching

### Available Skills with AI Coaching:
- **ðŸ”ª Knife Basics** - Analyzes grip, posture, cutting technique
- **ðŸ”¥ Heat Control** - Evaluates temperature management, pan heating
- **ðŸŒ¿ Seasoning & Flavor** - Reviews seasoning timing and technique  
- **ðŸ“‹ Mise en Place** - Assesses organization and preparation

### Using the AI Coach:

1. **Navigate to any skill lesson** (e.g., `/knife-basics`)
2. **Scroll down to the "AI Vision Coach" section**
3. **Click "Enable Camera"** (allow browser permissions)
4. **Position yourself** so the camera can see your hands and workspace
5. **Start practicing** the technique from the lesson
6. **Click "Get AI Feedback"** to capture and analyze your technique
7. **Receive personalized coaching** with specific improvement suggestions

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Best Results

### Camera Setup:
- **Good lighting** - Natural light or bright kitchen lighting works best
- **Clear view** - Camera should see your hands, knife, and cutting board
- **Stable position** - Place device on a stable surface or tripod
- **Angle matters** - Side angle often works better than directly overhead

### When to Capture:
- **During active technique** - While actually cutting, stirring, etc.
- **Different stages** - Capture setup, mid-technique, and final result
- **Multiple angles** - Try different camera positions for comprehensive feedback
- **After reading lesson** - Practice the specific technique being taught

### Privacy & Security:
- **No data stored** - Images are processed and immediately discarded
- **Local processing** - Only sends single frames to OpenAI for analysis
- **Camera control** - You control when camera is on/off and when to analyze

## ðŸ›  Technical Details

### Architecture:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **AI Vision**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API
- **Camera**: Browser MediaDevices API
- **Processing**: Real-time frame capture and analysis

### API Usage:
- Each analysis uses ~1-2 cents of OpenAI credits
- Optimized prompts for cooking-specific feedback
- Error handling for network issues and API limits

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues:
- **Permission denied**: Check browser permissions, refresh page
- **No camera found**: Ensure camera is connected and not used by other apps
- **Poor quality**: Try different lighting or camera angle

### API Issues:
- **"API key not configured"**: Check your `.env.local` file
- **"Quota exceeded"**: Add credits to your OpenAI account
- **"Analysis failed"**: Check internet connection, try again

### Performance:
